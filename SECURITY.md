## Reporting a Vulnerability

You may either send an e-mail to silvano.buogo@cnr.it to get a faster response,
generally within the same working day,
or place a message in 'Discussions'. The latter may be slower but has the advantage of letting
other users and collaborators know what it is about, so a better solution might be worked out collectively
although within a somewhat longer time.

Vulnerability reports are normally either accepted or declined within few days.
You may expect an updated version to be released after a vulnerability report is accepted 
within one or two weeks, depending on issue severity. To speed up the process, it is advised
to first report by e-mail, then keep track using Discussions.
