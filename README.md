# TUNE
Tool for Underwater Noise Evaluation

Copyright (C) 2024 Silvano Buogo, Junio Fabrizio Borsani, Valentina Caradonna

TUNE is a standalone Windows (R) application developed under MATLAB (R) for analysis of underwater audio files in WAV format.
Any number of input files can be processed in batch mode with few limitations on size, channels,
and sampling rates, to produce plots of SPL as well as PSD either in full bandwidth or in 
decidecade bands. 
A frequency dependent calibration file with arbitrary number of frequency points is applied before processing.
Results may be saved as graphics files or text files.

Based on previous project UWNoiPro (2020-2024)
