UWNoiPro is MATLAB code including GUI for analysis of underwater audio files in WAV format.
Any number of input files are processed in batch mode with few limitations on size, channels,
and sampling rates, to produce plots of SPL as well as PSD either in full bandwidth or in 
decidecade bands. 
A calibration file with arbitrary number of frequency points is applied before processing.
Results may be saved as graphics files or text files.

Serves as parent project of TUNA (2024-)
