UWNoiPro is MATLAB code including GUI for analysis of underwater audio files in WAV format.
Any number of input files are processed in batch mode with few limitations on size, channels,
and sampling rates, to produce plots of SPL as well as PSD either in full bandwidth or in 
decidecade bands. 
A calibration file with arbitrary number of frequency points is applied before processing.
Results may be saved as graphics files or text files.

UWNoiPro was an internal development project that evolved into TUNE at beginning of 2025
for external distribution after benchmarking and cross-validation with other software.

UWNoiPro code listed in this branch is NOT validated and is only included here for reference.
