# TUNE
Tool for Underwater Noise Evaluation

Copyright (C) 2025 Silvano Buogo, Junio Fabrizio Borsani, Valentina Caradonna

TUNE is a standalone Windows (R) application developed under Matlab (R) for analysis of underwater audio files in WAV format.
Any number of input files can be processed in batch mode with few limitations on size, channels, and sampling rates, to compute Sound Pressure Level (SPL) either over full bandwidth or in decidecade bands, as well as Power Spectral Density (PSD). 
A frequency dependent calibration file with arbitrary number of frequency points must be provided and is applied before processing.
Results may be saved as graphics files or text files.

Requires Matlab Runtime v. 9.5 (R2018b), which may be freely downloaded and installed either separately or using the installer.

See installation notes for system requirements.
