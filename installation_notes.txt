UWNoiPro - UnderWater Noise Processing
======================================
v. 5.0x - 08-mar-2024
Author: Silvano Buogo - CNR-INM - silvano.buogo@cnr.it

Installation notes

UWNoiPro executable is developed under Matlab environment and packaged as
a Windows standalone application requiring Matlab runtime v. 9.5 (R2018b). 
If not already present, runtime is freely and automatically downloaded 
from the web during installation.


1. System requirements

System requirements are the same as those for Matlab v. 9.5 (R2018b):

- Operating systems:
	Windows 10
	Windows 7 Service Pack 1
	Windows Server 2016, 2012 R2, 2012
	Note: Windows 8.1 not supported

- Processors:
	Any Intel or AMD x86-64 processor, 4 cores and AVX2 support recommended

- Minimum 3 GB Disk space, SSD recommended

- Minimum 4 GB RAM, 8 GB recommended

- No graphics card required, hardware accelerated graphics card supporting
  	OpenGL 3.3 with 1 GB GPU memory recommended.


2. Installation procedure

Launch the installer file "UWNoiPro505Installer_web.exe", then follow the
instructions. User is prompted to select installation folders for the executable
and for runtime.
If Matlab full program or runtime is not present or is installed with version(s)
different than v. 9.5, this runtime is installed using a proper separate target 
folder, possibly along with the existing one(s).  The installer skips runtime install 
if Matlab runtime v. 9.5 is detected, considerably reducing installation time. 
Note that some Matlab versions later than v. 9.5 may still support v. 9.5 runtime.

Runtime download size is about 800 MB, which may require quite some time on slow 
connections.

Alternatively, prior to installing UWNoiPro, download and install the Windows version 
of the MATLAB Runtime for R2018b from the following link on the MathWorks website:

    http://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/mcr/index.html
   
For more information about the MATLAB Runtime and the MATLAB Runtime installer, see 
"Distribute Applications" in the MATLAB Compiler documentation in the MathWorks 
Documentation Center.

For information on deployment terminology, go to
    http://www.mathworks.com/help 
    
and select 

    MATLAB Compiler > Getting Started > About Application Deployment > 
    Deployment Product Terms 
    
in the MathWorks Documentation Center.


3. Launching UWNoiPro application

UWNoiPro is started as a normal Windows application by double-clicking on it.
When starting for the first time, some additional time may be required to configure
Matlab runtime in the background, as if opening a regular full Matlab session.


4. Uninstalling UWNoiPro

UWNoiPro may be uninstalled using Windows standard system tool. Uninstalling UWNoiPro
does not uninstall Matlab runtime, which should be done separately.
